# Caching library

**Opis Cache** is a caching library with support for multiple backend storages that provides developers 
an API which allows them to deal with cached content in a standardised way, no matter where that content is stored.
Also, the **Opis Cache**'s simple and effective architecture ensures that support for new backend storages can be easily 
achieved by simply implementing an interface. 

The currently supported storages are: APC, APCU, File, Memory, Memcache, Memcached, MongoDB, 
Proxy, WinCache, XCache, ZendCache and ZendMemory.

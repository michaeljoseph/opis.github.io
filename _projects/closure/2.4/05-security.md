## Signing closures

While fetching and unserializing closures from a local file or from a local database,
that can not be accessed from outside is totally fine, there might be situations when
you will want to take some precautions before executing a closure. 

For example, if you are fetching serialized closures from a remote server,
you should definitely make sure that the closures were not altered on their way to your server. 

The simplest way of confirming a closure's authenticity is by using the `setSecretKey` method. 

**Remote server**

```php
use Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure;

SerializableClosure::setSecretKey('secret');

// Here you can serialize closures
$closure = function(){
   return "I'm a cryptographically signed closure";
};

push_to_server(serialize(new SerializableClosure($closure)));
```

**Your server**

```php
use Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure;

SerializableClosure::setSecretKey('secret');

// Here you can fetch closures from remote and unserialize them
$closure = unserialize(fetch_from_remote())->getClosure();
echo $closure(); //I'm a cryptographically signed closure
```

This method creates an instance of the `Opis\Closure\SecurityProvider` that will cryptographically sign the closure 
when it gets serialized and verify the signature when it's unserialized. 
If the signature is not valid an `Opis\Closure\SecurityException` is thrown.

## Custom security providers

**Important!**{:.important}
 You must make sure that the same security provider,
 with the same settings, is used both for serialization and unserialization.

If you are unhappy with the default security provider, you can use your own by creating a class that implements
the `Opis\Closure\ISecurityProvider` interface and passing an instance of that class to `addSecurityProvider` method.

```php
use Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure;
use Opis\Closure\ISecurityProvider;

class MySecurityProvider implements ISecurityProvider
{
   // ...
}

SerializableClosure::addSecurityProvider(new MySecurityProvider);

// Serialize closures here
```

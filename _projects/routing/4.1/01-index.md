# Routing framework
 
**Opis Routing** is a framework for building various routing components. 
In contrast to other routing libraries, it may handle anything that 
follows a pattern and is not limited only to HTTP request.

This library was conceived to be embedded by other libraries that need routing capabilities and not as a standalone 
library; although the usage of this library as a standalone library is not discouraged. 

## License
**Opis Routing** is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][apache_license].

## Requirements
* PHP 5.3.0 or higher
* [Opis Closure] ^2.0.0

## Installation

**Opis Routing** is available on [Packagist] and can be installed using [Composer]. 

```json
{
    "require": {
        "{{page.lib}}": "^{{page.version}}"
    }
}
```

If you are unable to use [Composer] you can download the [.tar.gz] or the [.zip]

# Limits and offsets

Limiting the number of results returned by a query, is achieved by using the `limit` method.

```php
$result = $db->from('users')
             ->orderBy('name')
             ->limit(25)
             ->select()
             ->all();
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM `users` ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 25
```

You can skip a certain number of records by using the `offset` method. 
The skipped records will not be added to the results set. 
This method can be used only in conjunction with the `limit` method.

```php
$result = $db->from('users')
             ->orderBy('name')
             ->limit(25)
             ->offset(10)
             ->select()
             ->all();
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM `users` ORDER BY `name` ASC LIMIT 25 OFFSET 10
```

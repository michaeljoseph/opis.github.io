<p>
    After a specified type was builded, the container allows you to manipulate the resulted object by defining one or more setters.
    Defining a setter is done by calling the <code>setter</code> method and passing an anonymous function callback as an argument
    to the method. The callback has two arguments: the instance of the builded type and the instance of the container.

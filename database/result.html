<h1><strong>Result set</strong></h1>

<p>
    Every time we query a database using the <code>select</code> method,
    instead of returning an array of results, <strong>Opis Database</strong> returns an
    instance of the <code>Opis\Database\ResultSet</code> class.
    By doing so, <strong>Opis Database</strong> allows us to have greater control over how the results will be further handled.
</p>
<p>
    Using the <code>all</code> method is perfectly fine when we are dealing with reasonable data sets, but
    we can quickly run out of memory if we are dealing with large data sets. This is because the <code>all</code>
    method transfer all the results from the database into PHP's memory and stores them into an array.
    One solution to avoid going out of memory when dealing with large data sets is to iterate through the
    entire result set and process one result at a time.

{% highlight php startinline %}
$result = $db->from('users')
             ->select(array('name', 'email'));
             
while(false !== $user = $result->next())
{
    echo $user->name, $user->email;
}
{% endhighlight %}

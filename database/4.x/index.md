**Opis Database** is a library that implements an abstraction layer over the PDO extension, 
by providing a powerful query builder along with an easy to use schema builder.
The aim of the library is to provide an unified way of interacting with databases,
no matter of the underlying relational database management system. 

Currently, we are officially supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, and SQLite.
We also provide experimental support - without any commitment regarding bug fixes and updates - 
for Firebird, IBM DB2, Oracle, and NuoDB query builder.

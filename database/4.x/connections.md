Interaction with a database is achieved with the help of the `Opis\Database\Database` class,
which provides various methods that will ease the process of manipulating tables and records.
The constructor of this class takes as an argument an instance of `Opis\Database\Connection`.

The `Connection` class is responsible both for establishing a connection to the database server,
as well as for sending and receiving data.
The constructor of the `Connection` class accepts parameters for specifying
the [DSN] and optionally for the username and password(if any).

```php
use Opis\Database\Database;
use Opis\Database\Connection;

$connection = new Connection(
    'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test',
    'username',
    'password'
);

$db = new Database($connection);
```

You can also create a connection by using the `fromPDO` static method and
passing an instance of the `PDO` class as an argument to the method.

```php
$connection = Connection::fromPDO($pdo);
```

## PDO options

The [DSN], the username and the password provided when instantiating a new
`Opis\Database\Connection` class, will be further used to build a `PDO` object that will actually
 establish a connection to the database.
**Opis Database** allows you to specify options for the `PDO` object by calling the `option` method.

```php
$connection = new Connection($dsn, $user, $password);
$connection->option(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, PDO::FETCH_OBJ)
$connection->option(PDO::ATTR_STRINGIFY_FETCHES, false);
```

Setting multiple options simultaneously is done by calling the `options` method
and passing as an argument an array of options.

```php
$connection = new Connection($dsn, $user, $password)
$connection->options([
    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_OBJ,
    PDO::ATTR_STRINGIFY_FETCHES => false
]);
```

## Persistent connections

Making a connection persistent is done by using the `persistent` method.

```php
$connection = new Connection($dsn, $user, $password);
$connection->persistent();
```

## Logging

You can keep a log with all of the queries sent to a database by calling the `logQueries` method.
Retrieving the list of logged queries is done using the `getLog` method.

```php
$connection = new Connection($dsn, $user, $password);
$connection->logQueries();

//Your queries...

foreach ($connection->getLog() as $entry) {
    echo $entry;
}
```

## Init commands

You also have the possibility to specify a list of commands that will be executed after connecting
to a database by using the `initCommand` method.

```php
$connection = new Connection($dsn, $user, $password);
$connection->initCommand('SET NAMES UTF8');
```

<h1><strong>Add new storages</strong></h1>

<p>
    Creating a new storage type is simply a matter of declaring a new class that implements the
    <code>Opis\Cache\StorageInterface</code> interface.
</p>

<p>
    The interface has five methods that need to be implementented in order to have a fully functional
    cache storage.
</p>

{% highlight php startinline %}
namespace Opis\Cache;

interface StorageInterface
{
    public function read($key);
    
    public function write($key, $value, $ttl = 0);
    
    public function delete($key);
    
    public function has($key);
    
    public function clear();
  
}
{% endhighlight %}


{% include subtitle.html value="The <em>write</em> method" h=4 %}

<p>
    This methods takes two arguments representing a key-value pair and optionally a third argument
    representing the amount of time(expressed in seconds) remained until the cache expires. If <code>0 (zero)</code>
    is passed as a third argument, the cache will never expire.
    This method must return <code>true</code> if the value was successfully stored at the specified key
    or <code>false</code> otherwise.
</p>

{% include subtitle.html value="The <em>read</em> method" h=4 %}

<p>
    This method takes a single argument representing the key used to store the cached content.
    If there is no associated content with the specified key, the method must return <code>false</code>.
    If there is content associated with the specified key, then the content must be first removed from cache,
    after which the method must return <code>false</code>.
    Otherwise the method returns the content stored at the specified key.
</p>

{% include subtitle.html value="The <em>has</em> method" h=4 %}

<p>
    This method takes a single argument representing the key that needs to be checked.
    If there is no cache content associated with the specified key, or if the cache content has
    expired, then the method must return <code>false</code>.
    Otherwise this method returns <code>true</code>.
</p>

{% include subtitle.html value="The <em>delete</em> method" h=4 %}

This method takes a single argument representing the key that needs to be deleted.
If there is no content associated with this key or if the content could not be deleted, then
this method must return <code>false</code>. Otherwise this method returns <code>true</code>.

{% include subtitle.html value="The <em>clear</em> method" h=4 %}

This method takes no arguments. When this method is called, all cached content stored by the current
storage must be deleted. If the deletion succeed, then this method returns <code>true</code> otherwise it
returns <code>false</code>.
